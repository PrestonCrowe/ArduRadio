# ArduRadio

This project includes 3 different projects that are encompased around Arduino-controlled radio chips.

I've included the EAGLE PCB files for all of the boards and their respective BOMs besides the V2, but that one uses off the shelf parts so it shouldn't be too hard to make one.

So far, the only board that is 100% complete is the V2 board. I have yet to create any code for the boards.
