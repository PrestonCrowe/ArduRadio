# ArduRadio
Some experimental (WIP) radio PCB designs that integrate Arduino in some way. Most of the designs are unfinished and/or untested, unless otherwise stated. The name might also be a placeholder until I figure out something better.

## Expination
#### TL;DR: I didn't know how to make PCB's earlier on, so I used off the shelf components and lots of pin headers. The newest version is completly custom. v1 and v3 are unfinished and all are untested.

I really like tinkering with radios, so I thought that it would be fun to make one some day. First, started with what I knew about Arduino and board design. The first version I worked on is unfinished, unpolished, and in all ways bulky. I was going for a modular design, with all off the shelf components, but it almost seemed like I wasn't doing any of the design work. This design, once finished, would be pretty good for beginners. I may or may not finish this one some day, but more than likely not. The second version is quite a bit better, and is finished(ish), but still is not great. Finally I get to my v3 design. This one, in all aspects, is fully custom. I am not using any off the shelf boards and I am routing all of the the connections myself. This one I am still working on and plan to make physical versions of. 

## Final Note
This is just some notes/warnigs I have.
* Suggestions and/or modifications are gladly accepted!
* <b> I am, in no way a profesional, so my designs will probably not work perfectly. </b>
* I only know and use EAGLE, so I won't post any other file types.
* I never made a BOM for v1 and v2, but they are labled and I can make one if asked.
* If v3 actually works when done, I might make a guide on Instuctables.

### Thanks for your time, and happy making!
